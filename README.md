# Tartis (Time and relative Trades in Space)
⚠️ At the moment this project is still work in progress ⚠️
## About
This will be a trading bot that uses signals from [Telegram](https://telegram.org).
### Limitations
At the beginning the bot will have a few limitations:
* Crypto only. No support for stocks or forex planned!
* Only the following exchanges are available (more might follow after the first release): 
  * Binance
  * Binance Futures
* Trading types: 
  * Daytrading, signal needs at least one entry and take profit target (stop loss is optional)
* Strict signal formatting rules, in order for the bot to read the signals you must follow a few rules.
* Must be self hosted, you can't invite other users to your tartis.
* You'll have to add your tartis bot to a channel in order to receive signals. Maybe I'll write a userbot in the future to make this unnecessary.

### Planned features
Currently I have planned the following features. I don't know yet when and if I can implement all of them but I will try my best.
* **Trading**: Open, close, mananage and overwatch your trades.
* **Autotrading**: Automatically open trades from certain channels.
* **Trailing**: Nothing better than moving your stop loss into profit.
* **Notifications**: Fall out of bed in shock at every trade.
* **History**: Always be reminded of your bad decisions.

## Disclaimer
I cannot guarantee any profit from using the bot. I am not responsible for any kind of losses that occur when using Tartis, be it due to bad trades or malfunctions of the bot.
